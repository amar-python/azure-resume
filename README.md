# azure-resume
My own azure resume following HPP project
In this ACG Project, Gwyn guides you through building your own resume integrated into GitHub and hosted on Microsoft Azure with Blob Storage, Azure Functions and CosmosDB. You'll be creating your own webpage with HTML and CSS, developing a CI/CD workflow with GitHub, and finally, deploying a static web app with a serverless database. 

ACG Projects is a series from A Cloud Guru. Designed to complete in a weekend, each project is a self-contained, hands-on activity that involves building something cool using cloud services.
